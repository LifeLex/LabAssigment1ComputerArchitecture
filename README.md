1. Introduction
You have to develop and app that using object oriented programming allows a teacher to do the following:
Assign 1, 2 o 3 marks to the students
Calculate the average grade according to the number of available grades.
Obtain the student with the best average grade, ONLY among those who have 3 grades.
To do this you have to take in account the following:
Teacher and student must inherit from the same base class and therefore have common members (attributes and methods) 
The base class must have an overloaded constructor that allows creating an object of the Teacher class and objects of the Student class, the fields: name, surnames and DNI(Spanish ID consistent of 8 numbers and a letter e.g 12345678A) should be given as parameters to the constructor 
The application should not have any type of menu for data entry. All data is created at compile time.
Considerations about the classes:
Student and teacher share data: name, surname, DNI (create these objects, with these attributes, using an overloaded constructor)
A teacher can perform these actions:
a) Add a new student to your student list.
b) Assign 1, 2 or 3 grades to a student (overload of methods).
c) Obtain the average grade of a student (average grade of 1, 2 or 3 grades).
d) Print on the screen the list of students showing their data and average grade.
e) Print on screen the student with the best grade (among students with 3 grades)
A student can perform these actions:
a) Obtain each of their notes, from their list of notes.
b) Return the number of notes they have in their list (size of the list).

Summarizing:
The program must print on the screen the list of students of the teacher and show the student with the best average grade among those who have 3 grades.




2. Fundamental requirements
The FUNDAMENTAL requirements to pass the practice are:
Classes must be used.
The inheritance must be implemented.
Lists should be used (Example: <vector>).
Methods must be used.
The main body of the program should look like this this:


3. How to delivery the lab assigment 
This delivery must be made through agora.unileon.es
The source code will be delivered in a single compressed file in zip format, whose format will be: User_id.practice1.zip
Where userid is the user of the electronic mail: userid@estudiantes.unileon.es
Deadline for submission: February 25, 2019.
